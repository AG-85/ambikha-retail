# **About the 'Retail' project**

You are an automation engineer in an online retailing company that has a unique opportunity to sell a brand new product. To make this achievable you need to build a new, complex system in a relatively short timeframe.
It is critical that there is a system that works and gets the job done, even if this means sacrificing functionality and even system stability.

Your job is to help your development team implement the first version of this system so you are able to sell the product in the requisite timeframe.
